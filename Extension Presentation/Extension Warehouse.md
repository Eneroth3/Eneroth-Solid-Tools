Solid tools designed to feel more native to SketchUp than the native solid
tools.

These tools modify components in place, the way components are supposed to work
in SketchUp. To opt out, first make the component unique.
The material inheritance is also honored. If you trim a wooden group by a
concrete group, the wooden group is still wood, even where it touches the
concrete. Layers, hidden states, axes and other properties are also preserved.
